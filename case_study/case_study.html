            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>This case study discusses the process I went through when creating a simple microinteraction and eventually a complex one for my 
                microinteraction class. I was introduced to microinteractions and their structure, and had to apply what I already knew how to do in code
                to create my own microinteraction and build on it throughout the course. I talk about the design choices I made and the steps I took
                to successfully code what I had planned to do for my microinteractions. For the final project, I was able to code my own complex
                microinteraction using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This was a project that I was working on during the Fall 2021 term for my IDM 241 Microinteractions class. In this class,
                I learned about what microinteractions are and their structure: triggers, rules, feedback, and loops and modes. We learned how to identify each
                component and then coded our own microinteractions using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I started with a basic microinteraction and added to it
                throughout the class to end it with a complex microinteraction for my final project.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>This solo project was assigned to challenge me to build on the HTML, CSS, and Javscript skills I had previously learned and
                successfully create a microinteraction. I had to apply what I already knew to create something that I had just learned
                in the beginning of the class. Microinteractions are an essential piece to a user's understanding of what they are doing 
                on an interface, so my microinteraction had to demonstrate that as well.

            <h2>Alpha Description</h2>
            <p>This was the first part of my project: creating a simple microinteraction. The hardest part about this assignment
                was coming up with what I would actually be using as my microinteraction. Most of my process consisted of searching
                for inspiration and choosing something really simple so I could make sure I understood how to code it and explain the structure of it.
                This microinteraction was triggered on a mouse hover.

            <p>After planning on what I would be doing for my simple microinteraction, it was now time to code it. I found a working example
                online and played with that code to see if it would work with my example. I worked in Visual Studio code and mainly used CSS
                transitions to make my microinteraction work. View my <a href="https://allisondrakedesign.com/idm241/alpha/build.html" target=_blank>Alpha Build</a> here.

                <h2>Beta Description</h2>
                <p>After building the alpha, I had to find a way to add on to the microinteraction to make it a little bit more complex. After a while of brainstorming,
                    I decided that I wanted to include a modal and have my alpha build be the second part of the microinteraction. I chose to make a share button that 
                    expands on a click and have links appear because I could see myself using it on my personal website.

                <h2>Beta Build</h2>
                <p>Once I had my description down, it was time to code. I found another working sample of what I wanted to replicate and started
                    coding the HTML and CSS. I then added a Javascript file to be able to open and close the button. When I tested it, it wouldn't work.
                    What I soon found out was that the working sample was using jQuery, and not Javascript. It
                    took me a while to figure it out, but I learned that I had to add a Jquery library to the HTML file to get the Jquery to run.
                    After that, the only difficulty I had was stylizing each link, and I figured that out by pinpointing each specific link and using the
                    correct class names to stylize them with my professor. View my <a href="https://allisondrakedesign.com/idm241/beta/build.html" target=_blank>Beta Build</a> here.

                <h2>Final Description</h2>
                <p>After the Beta project, it was time to make the microinteraction even more complex for my final. I felt good about the Beta, so for the final
                    I just had to add a few more things to complete the microinteraction. I decided that I wanted to add sounds for when the button expands and closes.
                    The hardest part about this was finding the sounds that I wanted to use and making sure that they made sense for this.
                    I also wanted to make the links actually work, so when the user clicks the link a separate window opens with that page.

                <h2>Final Build</h2>
                <p>It was time to start coding out my final description. I decided to focus on the links first, since I knew how to do that
                    better than the sounds. The only obstacle I faced for that part was taking the text-decoration away so that the links looked
                    the same as they did in the beta build. This is because default links appear blue and have an underline, and I didn't want that so I 
                    fixed that. After that, I worked on incorporating the sounds using Javascript. Searching for examples helped me to correctly
                    play the sounds on clicks, but the problem that I ran into was that after the initial click, every time I clicked the modal the sound would play.
                    I only wanted the sound to play once on the button open, and once on the button close. With direction from my professor, I learned how to do 
                    an open flag if statement so that if the button was clicked the sound would play once. View my <a href="https://allisondrakedesign.com/idm241/final/build/finalbuild.html" target=_blank>Final Build</a> here.

                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>Overall, I am happy with the final result and how I made my microinteraction more complex throughout the class. I successfully
                    coded a complex microinteraction with no breaks and errors using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. If there was something that I 
                    didn't know how to accomplish, I used my resources for guidance and learned a lot along the way. I was able to create a relationship 
                    between all three projects and it's easy to identify the gradual build up of the complexity of the microinteraction and difficulty it took
                    to code it. I also now know how to spot a microinteraction and how to dissect it into triggers, rules, feedback, and loops and modes. I enjoyed
                    coming up with creative ways to add to my microinteraction after starting from scratch.
