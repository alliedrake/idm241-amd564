            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This was a project that I was working on for my IDM 232 Scripting class. The class ran from late September to early December.
                In this class, I was introduced to the fundamentals of PHP and learned how to implement PHP into my recipe website. The biggest
                focus for this project were these four basic functions: create, read, update, and delete. The purpose of the project was to be able to perform CRUD
                using a database and dynamically add, edit, view, and delete recipes and users within the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>PHP is the next step in developing dynamic and interactive websites, so it's important as an UI designer that I learn these tools.
                PHP allows me to improve the functionality of the website to make the experience more enjoyable for the user. This language allows far
                more capabilities than what I currently know, so learning it and being able to implement it into my own website will be useful and allow me to 
                have a better understanding of development.</p>

            <p>Started with putting together a style tile for what I wanted the site to look like before I started on building templates.
               I looked at other recipe websites for inspiration and wanted to go with a lighter interface for readability purposes. </p>

            <h2>2. Alpha Design</h2>
            <p>Next I planned out what pages I would be including on my website and then began wireframing. Once I was finished
               with my low-fidelity wireframes, I began to stylize the content on each page and figured out what worked best with the 
               color palette that I chose.

            <h2>3. Coding Out the Pages</h2>
            <p>After designing each of my pages, I then began coding each page in HTML and tried my best to replicate what I had planned for. A lot of this part
                was making sure I stayed organized with my class names so that I could easily customize them using CSS. I enjoyed this part because I was able to 
                build off of my knowledge of HTML and CSS from previous classes, and the amount of time it took me to complete the alpha was far less then term long projects
                I completed in the past when I was first introduced to these languages. This is a screenshot of the home page that I coded.

                <h2>4. Implementing PHP</h2>
                <p>In this stage, I had to apply what I learned so far throughout the class into this beta assignment. I had to convert all of the HTML pages I made
                    into PHP files and preview my website using MAMP, a local server. This was the most intimidating part, but I found that if I looked back and reviewed
                    what we learned each week of the class, I was able to follow along and make sure I was doing the assignment correctly. I used PHP to make creating, reading, updating, and deleting
                    recipes and users possible as an admin on my pages. At this point of the project, everything was working perfectly
                    locally and the database I connected to my website was working.
