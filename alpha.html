        <h3>Triggers</h3>
        <p>The microinteraction will be triggered when the mouse hovers over the text.</p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>Once the microinteraction is tiggered, the line beneath the text expands slides up vertically from the bottom to the top of the text and forms a rectangle around the text.
           The color of the text dissolves into white and a drop shadow fades in around the rectangle that slid up. 
           Once the user hovers off of the text, the rectangle scales down and slides out vertically from the top to the bottom, returning to the starting postiion.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>When the user hovers, they will see the line under the text expand and form a background color behind the text. They will also see the color of the text change and the contrast
            between the text and background change. When the user hovers off, they will see that the text returns to the starting postion.
        </p>

        <h3>Loops and Modes</h3>
        <p>No loops or modes</p>
